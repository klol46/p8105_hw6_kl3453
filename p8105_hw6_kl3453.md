# Problem 1

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You
can read their accompanying article here.

``` r
raw_homicide_data =
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

**Data Process**

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved.

Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t
report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake.
For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is
white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

- Omit: Dallas, TX, Phoeniz, AZ, Kansas City, MO, and Tulsa Al
- Include only when victim_race == “white” or “black”
- victim_age has to be numeric

``` r
processs_homicide_data = 
  raw_homicide_data |> 
  
  #Create variable "city_state" which is a concatenation of city + state separated by , .
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) |> 
  
  #Omit Dallas, Phoenix, Kansas Ciry, and Tulsa
  filter(!grepl("Dallas, TX|Phoenix, AZ|Kansas City, MO|Tulsa, AL", city_state)) |> 
  
  #Include victim_race == "white" or "black"
  filter(grepl("White|Black", victim_race)) |> 
  
  #victim_age is numeric
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

## For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function…

to fit a *logistic regression* with resolved vs unresolved as the
outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors.

- Outcome: Resolved vs. Unresolved (1 or 0 Binary)
- PRedictors
  - Age: Continuous
  - Sex: Binary
  - Race: Binary

**Resolved vs. Unresolved (Binary Var)**

``` r
#Process Data
resolved_data =
  processs_homicide_data |> 
  
  #create binary variable that is 1 or 0 dpeending on if resolved or not
  mutate(resolve = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), 0, 1)) 
  
  #NOTE: glm is able to automatically define binary despite the variables being defined as strings. Race + Sex left alone
```

**Logistic Regression**

``` r
homicide_logistic =
  resolved_data |> 
  glm(resolve ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = _, family = binomial()) 
```

**Tidy**

Save the output of glm as an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this
object;

``` r
#Extract all parameter estimates from logistic regression
homicide_param_est = 
  homicide_logistic |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate), OR_CI = exp(confint(homicide_logistic))) |>
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, OR_CI, p.value)
```

    ## Waiting for profiling to be done...

**OR of Male vs. Female**

Obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio
for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping
all other variables fixed.

``` r
homicide_param_est_male_female = 
  homicide_param_est |> 
  filter(grepl("victim_sexMale", term))
```

- OR Estimate = 0.6028675
  - 95% CI: (0.568848, 0.6388225)

## Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset,

and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides
comparing male victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy”
pipeline, making use of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as
necessary to create a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each
city.

*Process Data*

``` r
citystate_nested_homicide = 
  resolved_data |> 
  nest(data = -city_state) |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(data, \(df) glm(resolve ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = df, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) |> 
  select(-data, -models) |> 
  unnest(results) |> 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) |>
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) |> 
  filter(grepl("victim_sexMale", term)) 
```
